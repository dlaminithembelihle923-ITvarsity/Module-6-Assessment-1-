                            <h3>INSECT HOUSE</h3>
    <p>Rhinoceros beetles are herbivorous insects named for the horn-like projections on and around the males' heads. Most are black, gray, or greenish in color, and some are covered in soft hairs. Another name given to some of these insects is the Hercules beetle, because they possess a strength of Herculean proportion.</p>
                           
                      <p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND IT?</p>
                      <p> Solitary bees like to be warm so having the hotel on a south-facing wall is another consideration to aid their inhabitancy. Therefore, the best position for insect hotels is in sunlight or light shade, preferably 1.5m off the ground.</p>
