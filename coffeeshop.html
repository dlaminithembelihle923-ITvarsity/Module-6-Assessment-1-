                            <h3>WILD THINGS COFFEE SHOP</h3>
     <p>A coffeehouse, coffee shop, or café is an establishment that primarily serves coffee of various types, e.g. espresso, latte, and cappuccino. ... In continental Europe, cafés serve alcoholic drinks. A coffeehouse may also serve food, such as light snacks, sandwiches, muffins, fruit, or pastries.</p>
                           <p>Coffee shops provide a place to gather, work, and drink. Smart use of atmospherics can not only help you attract more customers, but also create a space in which they'll savor both their coffee and their experience in your establishment.</p>
                           
                      <p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND IT?</p>
                      <p>if you're targeting employees on their way to work, opening your coffee shop in a family-friendly shopping center might cause your business to struggle in sales even if the location generates a lot of foot traffic. You'd be better off opening in an area close to an office park or in a business district.</p>
