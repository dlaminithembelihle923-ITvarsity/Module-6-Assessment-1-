                            <h3>MONKEY TRAIL</h3>
   <p>This challenging red (difficult) cross country MTB trail was first launched in 2010. The trail surface is very variable, in places expect loose stone, roots and mud. Designed with very experienced mountain bikers in mind, this trail is far more physically and technically challenging and demanding than Follow the Dog. It features bigger, stepper climbs and more technical descents.

A singletrack mountain bike trail which includes technical features and several black options. Expect flowing singletrack, medium berms, step ups, step downs, rock gardens, boardwalks, rollers, jumps and drop offs. The black difficult graded lines include large and unavoidable rocks and rock gardens.

The Monkey Trail start is reached after cycling the first 3.7km/2.29 miles of Follow the Dog Trail. The trail is managed in partnership with Chase Trails. Current highlights include Monkeyâ€™s Uncle, Upper and Lower Cliff.</p>
                           
                      <p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND IT?</p>
                      <p>Combined, the trail covers around 24km. After crossing the railway track and the A449, take a sharp right where the signs can be clearly seen. The Monkey is much more of an uphill slog than the Dog, however the technical stages are much more rewarding especially the two down hill sections at the end.</p>
